In this week I learned about DOM manupulation and build simple Todo Application.
At first we are going to see,
  - the diifference between static and dynamic website.
  - how to add todos.
  - how to delete todos.
  - simple Todo Application.
Advance DOM manupulation includes,
  - Create a mock Reconcilers.
  - State and State management.
